Embedded-PN532
==============

This is an open source NFC stack for the arduino microcontroller that allow peer-to-peer 
communication between an embedded platform and an Android NFC enabled device. The 
library implements the Ndef Push Protocol (NPP) and has been tested with an Android NFC-enabled phone
running Android 2.3.3.

NFC_Shield_DEV
==============
Android supports two peer-to-peer NFC protocols: NDEF Push Protocol (NPP) and Simple NDEF Exchange Protocol (SNEP). NPP 
was introduced in Android 2.3.3. SNEP was introduced in Android 4.0. Android 4.0 phones try SNEP first and then
use NPP. This repository implements NPP. Theoretically it should work with Android 4.0 phones that support SNEP. However, 
I have not heard of a success case. A fork of this project NFC_Shield_DEV implements the newer SNEP protocol. I 
recommend phones that use Android 4.0 or newer use the fork (SNEP protocol). Furthermore, it has bug fixes that have
not been backported to this repository.

Example
==============
The example is arduino program that send and recieves NDEF messages that contain text. When it recieves an 
NDEF message, it retrieves the text payload from the NDEF message and updates the NDEF message it sends to 
contain the recieved text payload. The program works with the example Android NFC program, stick notes 
(The code for stick notes can be found at http://nfc.android.com/).
